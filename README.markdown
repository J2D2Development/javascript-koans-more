# Javascript Koans - koans to learn Javascript (the good bits) #

Based on Edgecase's fantastic 
[Ruby koans](http://github.com/edgecase/ruby_koans), the goal of the
Javascript koans is to teach you Javascript programming through
testing.

This whole thing is borrowed so I can practice.  See credits below- thanks go to them!

The test runner used is [Jasmine](http://pivotal.github.com/jasmine/) with a
customized report viewer.

### Inspirations & thanks

*  Dick Wall (the Java posse) - for bringing the idea of koans to my attention
*  Edgecase - for the great Ruby Koans
*  Douglas Crockford - for Javascript; the good bits
